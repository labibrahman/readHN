<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">The problem is that 'computational thinking' has become expected of a university education, <i>regardless of major</i>, but universities haven't shifted to meet the need.<p>All the other basic requirements of a university education are filled through entry level classes - credit-fillers that students have to take in order to graduate. This structure works out well for everyone: the university ensures that students are getting a well-rounded education (as opposed to a trade-school degree) and maintains its reputation and the value of its product.</p><p>The only classes that students can take to demonstrate an ability in computational thinking are CS classes. Entry level CS classes, like those in the other engineering disciplines, are not like entry level classes in non-engineering disciplines. Most students that take ARCH 101 and LIT 101 are not taking them because they are interested in pursuing the major, they take them because they were the best-sounding classes that help them to fill their credit requirements. In doing so, they end up with a well-rounded education. In contrast, most students that take EE 101 are trying out for EE as a major.</p><p>CS entry level classes traditionally fell into the latter category. Demand has resulted in students treating them as part of the former.</p><p>The best thing a university could do is to figure out what skills that these employers are all demanding and offer entry-level classes to fill the need. Structure them to work with large numbers of students, just like all the other 100 and 200 level classes that everyone takes.</p><p>Here's the key part: advertise these classes relentlessly, to students and employers. Talk about how the university has seen the demand for these skills and has shifted to focus on them. Become known as a university where every student can get these skills as a part of their education, regardless of major, and most choose to.</p></font><p><font color="#000000">Potential students will be thrilled at the prospect of a university where they can get a bankable education without having to commit to CS as a major. Strain on the CS major will go down and prestige will increase - if every student is getting the kinds of CS skills that employers require, then the ones that enter the major must be the hardest of the hardcore.</font></p><p><font size="1"><u><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=7793755&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%37%39%33%33%30%35">reply</a></u></font></p></span></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="./Responding to the Explosion of Student Interest in Computer Science [pdf]   Hacker News_files/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7794145" onclick="return vote(this)" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=7794145&dir=up&by=L_Rahman&auth=6cc784786a13956e618dd676900f13b3265dc274&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%37%39%33%33%30%35"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7794145"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=shabadoop">shabadoop</a> 18 hours ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7794145">link</a></span></div><br>

Demand has resulted in students treating them as part of the former.<p>I was in a funny position with this.  In university, I had taken the engineering "Intro to C" class as a first year student, but when I switched to a math major, I had to take the intro level CS classes.</p><p>Now, the first year CS classes are required for math, physics and chemistry majors at my school so you'd expect the syllabus to take that into account.  The class was almost entirely built around working with the Java API and object hierarchies and writing bloated Java programs to perform simple tasks. It was a huge waste of time, and I didn't have much time to spend on a freshman level general ed requirement. I like to think my whining was one of the reasons why the math department finally made the push to offer a scientific programming course for the rest of the science departments.</p></font><p><font color="#000000">I don't mean to bash my school's CS department, either.  I took some higher level Systems Programming and Algorithms courses and thought they were fantastic.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">I TA'd an entry-level CS 100 class, it counted as a core science credit and covered a good variety of the field of CS with the time it had.  The curriculum was something along the lines of: hardware basics, binary math and logic, basic programming, algorithms, computer graphics, crypto, AI.  Granted they didn't get very deep into any one topic but a few students came out of that class with the intention of switching to a CS major, and the others got more than they had anticipated from the class.  Most of the students enjoyed programming in Scratch, except for those that had programmed before.  Coincidentally, I was blown away by what some people managed to do with Scratch in a couple weeks.</font><p><font color="#000000">The professor was recently written up in the NYT for her efforts to get a more solid CS curriculum into highschools, so perhaps this was an unusual course offering.</font></p><p><font size="1"><u><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=7794267&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%37%39%33%33%30%35">reply</a></u></font></p></span></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="./Responding to the Explosion of Student Interest in Computer Science [pdf]   Hacker News_files/s.gif" height="1" width="80"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7794878" onclick="return vote(this)" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=7794878&dir=up&by=L_Rahman&auth=70186e6422ba77ff4a230a27b15900124ca6b043&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%37%39%33%33%30%35"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7794878"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=seanmcdirmid">seanmcdirmid</a> 13 hours ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7794878">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">It's unfair to highly skilled people, because it would bore the hell out of them. That's how you weed out the top 1% and breed a normalized group of students. I truly understand why some of the super-skilled people I know didn't even consider going to any higher school, but still beat the shit out of the PhD's that I know, when it comes to a) knowledge b) theoretical and practical skill c) solid maths + formal verification. It doesn't mean that universities suck, but they polarize skills towards industrial demand and forget about the diversity of culture that arrived, they are about to eliminate for the greater good of the industrial market,  which manifests in the number of graduates. But oh beware, that too many graduate, as if that would mean that the university is cheap and will loose it's prestige. Professors tend to hate it, when too many pass their exams and often times help to let some % of the students fail on purpose, to keep up their "prestige". If every single professor explained thinks like on Reddit's ELI10 and used interactive media to underline the structure behind a problem, then almost everybody would pass. So, does a high number graduations automatically mean that the university only teaches low-skill courses, resulting in low-quality students? I'd say no, if they teached students more efficiently.</font></span><p><font size="1"><u><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=7796282&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%37%39%33%33%30%35">reply</a></u></font></p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="./Responding to the Explosion of Student Interest in Computer Science [pdf]   Hacker News_files/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7794119" onclick="return vote(this)" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=7794119&dir=up&by=L_Rahman&auth=5893a4dcd81bdaad9e3e6544349ef123bde19126&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%37%39%33%33%30%35"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7794119"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jimmaswell">jimmaswell</a> 18 hours ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7794119">link</a></span></div><br>

This structure works out well for everyone: the university ensures that students are getting a well-rounded education (as opposed to a trade-school degree)<p>Do you really think the irrelevant classes are necessary at this level though? The student has had all of elementary through high school to be exposed to the broad subject range. By the time you enter university you should know what you're doing.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Yes, yes, yes.  I think good universities (i.e, most of their faculty and administration) still believe strongly in the "rounded education" goal.  As you say, historically universities sought to provide a liberal education, regarding subjects that "were considered essential for a free person (a citizen) to know in order to take an active part in civic life. . . . The aim of these studies was to produce a virtuous, knowledgeable, and articulate person." [ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_arts" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_arts</a> ]</font><p><font color="#000000">It's mostly the students now who don't believe in a well-rounded education, who just want to prepare themselves for a job.  I'm fifty years old and I've observed the trend towards higher education becoming more and more like vocational education.  It began before I was born, but it surely seems to be accelerating.  Frequent articles on whether college can be "economically justified" are representative of this.  Formerly, there was no question of whether a liberal arts (i.e., "well rounded") education would somehow "pay off".  It was something desirable for its own sake, part of becoming a better person.</font></p><p><font size="1"><u><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=7794432&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%37%39%33%33%30%35">reply</a></u></font></p></span></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="./Responding to the Explosion of Student Interest in Computer Science [pdf]   Hacker News_files/s.gif" height="1" width="120"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7794450" onclick="return vote(this)" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=7794450&dir=up&by=L_Rahman&auth=384cda22ae1d72f3290a3149ddb307675c9d6295&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%37%39%33%33%30%35"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7794450"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=unclebucknasty">unclebucknasty</a> 16 hours ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7794450">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">There now exist options in engineering which are comparable with those in finance, and importantly, there is now a credible case that engineering is one of the best median outcome career paths for a bright student who is willing to push whatever lever and turn whatever knob required to get to professional success.  Stanford undergrads with their degrees still wet are getting $1X0,000 offers from AmaGooFaceSoft.  That's roughly comparable to management consulting or the anticipated returns to early-career finance majors.<p>When I graduated, back in the mists of history in 2004, you'd be <i>crazy</i> to assume that a 5th year engineer salary package would be approaching $300k.  There was a huge salary gap in finance's favor on day one, it got bigger every year, and it exploded once the financiers started to hit their 30s.  That gap has narrowed considerably, at least for folks on that trajectory in their 20s.  (I'll confess to not having a great understanding of what it looks like to be a 32 year old at Google.  I mean, any 32 year old at Google who was with them in 2004 is now a multimillionaire several times over, but I don't know what the reasonable modeling is for expectations for being 32 in 2024.)</p></font><p><font color="#000000">The folks who think they're going to be in the top 10th of engineers AmaGooFaceSoft hire this year in terms of career success 10 years out now have a reasonable expectation that that will be as lucrative as a top 10th finance career.</font></p><p><font size="1"><u><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=7793649&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%37%39%33%33%30%35">reply</a></u></font></p></span></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="./Responding to the Explosion of Student Interest in Computer Science [pdf]   Hacker News_files/s.gif" height="1" width="160"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7793745" onclick="return vote(this)" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=7793745&dir=up&by=L_Rahman&auth=24bd19db8ea30bc6994d312f5a4eac41f276d524&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%37%39%33%33%30%35"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7793745"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=hkmurakami">hkmurakami</a> 20 hours ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7793745">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">The gap is closing for the first few years of engineering vs finance (first 3 years of comp in finance is definitely a lot lower now vs 2007, whereas first 3 years of comp at GOOG post 2009 has exploded), but the gap grows as you approach your mid 30's. When you're getting to $300k at GOOG, your buddy is over $500k at GS as a VP (VP is middle managemnt in high finance and iirc the high fliers get there in 6 years). Fast forward a few more years, and you're making $500k at GOOG and the buddy is well over $1MM. The gap will continue to grow in size exponentially thereafter.<p>I guess $300k vs $500k is much improved compared to $1X0k vs $500k that we would have been looking at a decade ago though :P</p><p>In addition, perhaps the parity is better when you compare median results rather than upper quintiles.</p></font><p><font color="#000000">Btw, first year management consultants make nowhere close to $100k (though they can make up for it with Starwood points and frequent flier miles on United -- no joke). You'll only top $100k once you're an associate, which is after your 2+2 (2 years as an analyst, 2 years of bschool). Only 3-5% of the analyst class goes straight to associate. Students who enter as an analyst are doing it primarily for the great education and training McK/BCG/Bain give you, and definitely aren't making the choice based on monetary incentives.</font></p><p><font size="1"><u><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=7793745&whence=%74%68%72%65%61%64%73%3f%69%64%3d%70%61%74%69%6f%31%31">reply</a></u></font></p></span></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="./Responding to the Explosion of Student Interest in Computer Science [pdf]   Hacker News_files/s.gif" height="1" width="200"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7793964" onclick="return vote(this)" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=7793964&dir=up&by=L_Rahman&auth=48bf8a3663e6b2d5999e1b3cfaf7645db6c1fc96&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%37%39%33%33%30%35"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7793964"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=null_ptr">null_ptr</a> 19 hours ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7793964">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">This number is very deceiving so be careful comparing your salary with it. Problem is that vast majority of population does not live in the SF, NYC, Seattle area so the median of entire US population is not comparable for people who live in these areas. The median metric is especially notorious in eliminating outliers like these areas.<p>Even within these areas, you want to compare your income with median in your closest <i>neighbourhood</i> of about 10,000 people. In most of these neighbourhoods with tech population, $90 would probably place you in bottom 30% bucket. In essence, you will be relatively "poor" and get pushed you out to fat outer areas of community where there are either no good schools, facilities and/or commute is ridiculous.</p></font><p><font color="#000000">Always look at median of your target neighbour to compare your income, not the national median.</font></p><p><font size="1"><u><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=7795965&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%37%39%33%33%30%35">reply</a></u></font></p></span></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="./Responding to the Explosion of Student Interest in Computer Science [pdf]   Hacker News_files/s.gif" height="1" width="120"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7793765" onclick="return vote(this)" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=7793765&dir=up&by=L_Rahman&auth=8003526402695cbc998ee7699418f1e509afa1be&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%37%39%33%33%30%35"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7793765"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=randomdata">randomdata</a> 20 hours ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7793765">link</a></span></div><br>

The migration seems similar to the hypothetical situation in which universities and society had primarily been based on an oral tradition of communication, and then this fancy new technology called "writing" appeared (at first only in "Departments of orthography science"). Some of those who majored in "orthography science" would go on to study it, comparing and contrasting the features of phonetic of symbolic writing methods. Many others would learn orthography science because it enabled them to learn and communicate much more efficiently in general.</font><p><font color="#000000">Who wants to place bets on when country development metrics include "population % who know how to code" ... ?

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">I completely disagree.<p>Having everyone knowing how to code is the opposite of specialisation. It's inefficient and pointless. If a certain profession needs a piece of software, it's much more efficient for specialist developers to consult with domain experts, write that software, and sell it into the industry. Having every (for example) doctor being able to code adds negligible value, and I would argue the opportunity cost is awful. If my doctor has a choice to become a very mediocre coder or a better doctor, I would hope they choose the latter.</p><p>As for the comparison to literacy, there's simply no comparison. Illiterate societies are unable to progress past agrarian economies because illiteracy precludes specialisation, prevents the dissemination of knowledge, and makes it almost impossible to learn new things except by imitation or direct instruction. Literacy is a necessary skill in order to do much beyond dirt farming. Illiterate people can't, for example, even follow a moderately complex checklist. In contrast, I see no negative impact on society if most people can't code.</p><p>I don't spend my time studying anatomy; my micro-surgeon shouldn't spend his time studying coding, and I don't see how it would do anything but make him less effective if he did.</p></font><p><font color="#000000">A society of part-time coders would do nothing but produce a lot of badly-written toy programs.

He runs his own private practice. When he opened the clinic in the early 90s, he quickly realized that keeping track of patient records in paper format was not efficient. So he taught himself Microsoft Access (which came out in 1992!) and wrote his own patient record management software, which greatly increased his productivity and therefore income/leisure time.</p><p>Fast-forward to 2011. I was organizing an international conference and needed to send out some email blasts. The problem was, all the email addresses I needed were on a several hundred page PDF document with no clear format. So I had a choice: I could spend days manually copy-pasting and cleaning stuff up, or I could try to automate it. I ended up writing a Ruby script that grabbed the embedded text and pattern-matched email addresses and spat them out onto a text file. Still not perfect (my regex was rudimentary) but it got the job done a lot faster. Learning basic Ruby took me several hours, and I ran into some (silly) issues [1], but that's still better than the several days I would have spent doing the task manually.</p><p>You may be thinking, "well, we have specialists for that sort of thing today." Sure. But just like there are many rural areas in the US where it doesn't make economic sense for ISPs to lay out fiber, there are many personal tasks and errands where it doesn't make sense for professional developers to write software for. So there is a lot to be said for the need for individual empowerment through programming.</p></font><p><font color="#000000">[1]<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6566884/rubys-file-open-gives-no-such-file-or-directory-text-txt-errnoenoent-er" rel="nofollow">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6566884/rubys-file-open-g...</a></font></p><p><font size="1"><u><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=7794011&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%37%39%33%33%30%35">reply</a></u></font></p></span></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="./Responding to the Explosion of Student Interest in Computer Science [pdf]   Hacker News_files/s.gif" height="1" width="200"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7794071" onclick="return vote(this)" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=7794071&dir=up&by=L_Rahman&auth=53854eb36eb587f9600ae37af6a48b23973d5c17&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%37%39%33%33%30%35"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7794071"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=kimdouglasmason">kimdouglasmason</a> 18 hours ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7794071">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">I'm still not convinced by those examples. My reasoning is opportunity cost.<p>If you have to learn to code to write some software, and then write it yourself, you will generally be less efficient at it than contracting someone else to do so. Furthermore, the contractor has a chance of potentially reselling the software to other clients (thus increasing efficiency even more), which you do not.</p><p>If it was cheaper for your father to write his own software in this case, then to me this indicates one of several things:
1. That he had already learned to code for some other reason (possibly a hobby).
2. That there was no opportunity cost because his business was operating way below capacity. If this is the case, his time is best spent fixing that problem first.
3. That there is an under-developed market for software services.</p><p>Your fathers' example also ignores some potential problems. A novice rolling their own DB code is likely to make novice mistakes, increasing the chance of (expensive) data loss or corruption.</p></font><p><font color="#000000">I remain unconvinced that for a busy non-software specialist (such as a physical therapist, a welder, and many other professions) writing any software more complicated than a spreadsheet formula or macro is worth the opportunity cost. That doesn't mean that these people will never configure existing software, or write small scripts in DSLs, but I don't consider that 'knowing how to code' any more than I consider being able to remove one of my own teeth 'knowing how to dentist'.</font></p><p><font size="1"><u><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=7794071&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%37%39%33%33%30%35">reply</a></u></font></p></span></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="./Responding to the Explosion of Student Interest in Computer Science [pdf]   Hacker News_files/s.gif" height="1" width="240"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7795161" onclick="return vote(this)" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=7795161&dir=up&by=L_Rahman&auth=e42624685740e22463b34bd00245433c12607c39&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%37%39%33%33%30%35"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7795161"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=zAy0LfpBZLC8mAC">zAy0LfpBZLC8mAC</a> 11 hours ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7795161">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color="#5a5a5a">Well, I agree that non-professionals probably should avoid writing anything complicated, as there is a high risk that they will make bad mistakes.</font><p><font color="#5a5a5a">However, that IMO does not mean that it's not good for essentially everyone to have at least some basic knowledge of programming and CS basics. For one, communicating your needs to a professional is also pretty costly, especially so when the task at hand also needs specialized knowledge from your own field (be it that communicating the requirements is a lot of work upfront or that the project in the first (few) round(s) doesn't end up doing what you expected it to do - not exactly unheard of in the software world), and secondly, even if the problem that you need to solve is too difficult for you to solve with your basic knowledge, that basic knowledge might still be very helpful in communicating the problem to the professional, as you might be able to see what kind of information the professional needs in order to help you. Plus, it might allow you to better select a good professional - the risk of hiring someone who isn't actually all that much of a professional is pretty real, after all, so adding to the costs of not learning and doing it yourself.</font></p><p><font size="1"><u><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=7795161&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%37%39%33%33%30%35">reply</a></u></font></p></span></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="./Responding to the Explosion of Student Interest in Computer Science [pdf]   Hacker News_files/s.gif" height="1" width="240"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7794631" onclick="return vote(this)" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=7794631&dir=up&by=L_Rahman&auth=12c180bd67342b3947181e7472b23dad50b541e3&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%37%39%33%33%30%35"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7794631"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=angersock">angersock</a> 15 hours ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7794631">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Instead of looking for the negative impact on society, have you tried looking for the possible positive impact _if_ everyone knew basic CS and programming? I see that those should logically be isomorphic, but I think the way you frame the question makes a big difference as to what you will discover.<p>I think literacy is a very good comparison. Society certainly did work without everyone being literate, with just a few specialists who knew how to read and write, and there was no obvious need for everyone to learn it, and it is a huge investment of time and effort for everyone who has to go through it, so it would seem like a natural candidate for specialization, wouldn't it? Yet, as you note, essentially universal literacy has transformed the way we live massively for the better, and few would argue that this massive investment of every single person is not worth it and we should return to specialists taking care of our reading and writing.</p><p>Now, the question is: What would a society with universal knowledge of CS and programming basics look like? What would future kimdouglasmasons say when they claim that some new skill is not worth teaching to everybody because there simply is no comparison to computationality? How were pre-computational societies fundamentally held back in their progress, what kind of fundamental transformations of society would never have been possible if people had stayed uncomputational?</p><p>Your example isn't particularly helpful. Anatomy is not a widely applicable set of skills. There never is any question of whether you could use the help of an anatomist to help you solve an anatomy problem with your new motor design or your new soup recipe. Automated computation, much like literacy, essentially can be applied everywhere. That's why you write "it's much more efficient for specialist developers to consult with domain experts". That sentence only makes sense for universally applicable skills - I doubt many anatomists often consult with domain experts because they need to apply their knowledge in a field they so far have no clue of.</p></font><p><font color="#000000">Also, the grocery lists a literate society writes also aren't of particular literary value. That does not mean that society isn't better of for people being able to write them. And to appreciate more the works of those who still are "literacy professionals", who obviously still have their place in society.</font></p><p><font size="1"><u><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=7795226&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%37%39%33%33%30%35">reply</a></u></font></p></span></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="./Responding to the Explosion of Student Interest in Computer Science [pdf]   Hacker News_files/s.gif" height="1" width="80"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7793718" onclick="return vote(this)" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=7793718&dir=up&by=L_Rahman&auth=a5df388746a0bda2721280541018762f140f74a0&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%37%39%33%33%30%35"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7793718"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=wanderingstan">wanderingstan</a> 21 hours ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7793718">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Implicit in what you've written is the idea that humanity has reached some kind of end state in contemporary modernity. Yet given the accelerating pace of change, when the humans of 200 years from now look back on us, they'll undoubtedly see us as even more primitive and different than humans from the 1800s do to us today. Future-humans might even lament how poor and stuck we all were, perhaps in large part because so few of us could program.<p>Illiterate societies indeed tend to not progress, and humanity at the moment has massive problems that it shows little evidence of being able to contend with. You're completely right that existing professions, as currently practiced, benefit little from adding to them an ability to program. Yet we're seeing a massive trend away from many current professions, as currently practiced. Many jobs are getting automated out of existence[1]. The chief culprit?

In decades we should see the complete replacement of human labor in many surgical procedures, since a programmed machine can be much more precise and interpret the bodies signals and vitals in much greater clarity. But do you want doctors, the experts on performing these procedures, writing the code, or do you you want programmers who know to ironlad it against unexpected behavior to write the code? (trick question, we want both, but the doctors need to be computer literate and the programmers medically literate, but usually the later is more true than the former).</p><p>I think there is a misnomer equating computer literacy with writing software. The latter can give the former, but it doesn't always happen - I know <i>many</i> SEs who can't point out a hard drive from RAM, and couldn't make heads or tails of problems out of their niche domain. That isn't really computer literacy either, even if they live in a deep crevase within it.</p><p>I think computer literacy, as others in this thread have pointed out, should be its own course - just like English literature. You want to convey the macroscopic concepts and motivations and overarching conventions, rather than the minute details. The analogy would be do you care about sentence structure, word density, and subliminal messaging in Lit 101 - well, no, you care about overarching plot and meaning.</p></font><p><font color="#5a5a5a">Any computer literacy class should have a cirriculum teaching its students what code <i>is</i>, but that doesn't mean they need to know how to write it. They should just understand how the machines in their day to day lives work, and how to control them if they want to from there. Because so many people are misinformed or just ignorant about what these magical glowy screens of letters and pictures actually <i>are</i> to begin with. It is the difference between being able to appreciate literature and being able to write world class novels.</font></p><p><font size="1"><u><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=7795231&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%37%39%33%33%30%35">reply</a></u></font></p></span></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="./Responding to the Explosion of Student Interest in Computer Science [pdf]   Hacker News_files/s.gif" height="1" width="80"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7793977" onclick="return vote(this)" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=7793977&dir=up&by=L_Rahman&auth=f88fd4b3b3cd2eee2124bd4d6046831357529f69&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%37%39%33%33%30%35"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7793977"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=hershel">hershel</a> 19 hours ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7793977">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">This is another example of a field where coding is relevant to the job. Many current scientific methods involve heavy use of computers for things like simulation, complex calculation, or control of custom built equipment.<p>I still maintain there are many professions where coding is almost completely irrelevant. Some scientists use general purpose programming languages as part of their work. No (for example) physical therapist does this as part of their work.</p><p>Many people on this board also seem to underestimate just how difficult it can be to learn to code for many people who have skills in other areas. People who are studying science are probably the type who are good at coding. If you want to see how difficult coding is for many, just look at the drop-out rates in Computer Science 1.</p></font><p><font color="#000000">The general argument that I am responding to is that coding is comparable to literacy. I argue that both in need and applicability, it simply is not. If you are illiterate, the number one thing you can generally do to improve your life is learn to read. I argue that unlike literacy, there are many professions where learning how to code provides less benefit than spending that effort learning or doing something else.</font></p><p><font size="1"><u><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=7794142&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%37%39%33%33%30%35">reply</a></u></font></p></span></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="./Responding to the Explosion of Student Interest in Computer Science [pdf]   Hacker News_files/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7793616" onclick="return vote(this)" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=7793616&dir=up&by=L_Rahman&auth=f55737e5957468b0171fe48f5c91ddc5dbc76e0d&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%37%39%33%33%30%35"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7793616"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=tres">tres</a> 21 hours ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7793616">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">It is so important to foster and support the growth of the CS curriculm, at all levels but at the university level especially. We need these classes to be well taught, and well funded. If 1000 students all want to learn the same thing, that's a lot of funding to do some really interesting and amazing things. This is not about provisioning more lecture halls!<p>The way students pick classes is a lot different from the way that a consumer spends money. You're already committed to spending a certain amount, especially if it's not impacting your major, class selection is a different set of variables. But I'm sure the surge in CS enrollment is at least partially mirrored in a broad increase of CSed spending overall.</p></font><p><font color="#000000">What leaves me nervous is, I wonder if the tool set is really ready for mass adoption. The most direct effect of massively increased enrollment, and massively increased class size, will be overall more people who know how to code, which would be great, but also significantly lower median coder ability. Which will have a large impact over time.</font></p><p><font size="1"><u><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=7795609&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%37%39%33%33%30%35">reply</a></u></font></p></span></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="./Responding to the Explosion of Student Interest in Computer Science [pdf]   Hacker News_files/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7795945" onclick="return vote(this)" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=7795945&dir=up&by=L_Rahman&auth=f9c8d6f37358e88980779f8565dda2d186732157&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%37%39%33%33%30%35"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7795945"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=sytelus">sytelus</a> 4 hours ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7795945">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Increase in supply, yes, but the question is if the demand will grow more quickly than the supply. If it does then salaries will keep rising (though probably more slowly). If supply growth outpaces demand growth then salaries will drop.<p>I don't think we really know enough about programming demand growth right now to make a call either way, we also don't know the scale of the CS graduate expansion.</p><p>In any case, this is a terribly simplistic view of things. Not all graduates are created equal, and not all jobs demand the same programmers. Neither programmers nor programming jobs are fully interchangeable widgets.</p><p>In reality there are multiple buckets to programmer supply, and multiple buckets to programmer demand. This is sort of the nice way of saying that there is a gradient between "has a CS degree but can't code out of a wet paper bag and probably never will" and "has a CS degree and knows how to solve truly hard problems and has the right foundations to be an excellent engineer".</p><p>IMO when people are entering a field purely for the cash, the latter pool won't expand by that much, but the former pool will expand greatly. This will depress salaries on one end of the industry but the impact on the other end won't be extreme. A dramatic expansion in CS enrollment IMO will cause a crunch in low-mid-end programming salaries while leaving high-end programming salaries mostly intact.</p></font><p><font color="#000000">My main concern is if these college students are being sold a lie. Schools are holding up Google and Facebook engineers (and their salaries) as templates, but in reality most of them will end up writing enterprise code for a megacorp somewhere for $60K a year, and in fact the bulk of programming jobs in this country are much closer to that than they are to your archetypical Silicon Valley $200K job. This concern goes double for the Hacker School phenomenon, since they smell more opportunistic and get-rich-quick-y than traditional 4-year programs.</font></p><p><font size="1"><u><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=7793646&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%37%39%33%33%30%35">reply</a></u></font></p></span></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="./Responding to the Explosion of Student Interest in Computer Science [pdf]   Hacker News_files/s.gif" height="1" width="80"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7793966" onclick="return vote(this)" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=7793966&dir=up&by=L_Rahman&auth=c5aab1ebe0d9a7caebefa89e6e349db7db33747a&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%37%39%33%33%30%35"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7793966"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=codesuela">codesuela</a> 19 hours ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7793966">link</a></span></div><br>

I can believe a lot of public universities have quotas on CS undergrads (and other majors, especially ones that require labs, and until recently as these things go that was a big issue for CS), but it's the mark of a good private school that if an undergraduate wants to major in X, they'll find a way.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">In relation to "coding becoming the next literacy" and having demographics on people who know how to code...<p>What use does a mere "learning to code" actually have to most people? How do we measure fluency in "coding"?</p><p>Think about it. A crash course on basic procedural constructs like loops, variables, functions and maybe some simple exercises where one makes use of a language's standard library is not particularly useful. Even the conceptual knowledge that one gains is relatively minimal.</p><p>It's not like the huge percentages of people "knowing how to code" will do anything meaningful with it. Why? Because they wouldn't have the skill.</p><p>Many discussions revolving around compulsory code education seem to completely ignore the tons of domain-specific knowledge one requires to put coding skills to any real use. It's likely that little of the "code literates" will ever contribute to an open source project, for instance.</p><p>This is because besides code, you have (potentially): a build system, continuous integration, documentation generator, actual protocols that must be understood (HTTP, DNS, FTP, etc.), use of OS-specific system calls and constructs, general knowledge of memory layout, knowledge of system administration, etc.</p><p>These are merely condensed into a nutshell. Code by itself is of little use without actually knowing how computers work in general, which is no small task to comprehend, and requires tons of domain-specific knowledge as to the many abstractions we have created around software and hardware. It's a perpetual learning experience. A person who has learned rudimentary C is of little use in any serious project that requires knowledge of the POSIX and/or glibc API, for instance.</p><p>It's a completely meaningless metric in general. Most people will just do some basic imperative coding in a highly abstracted knowledge with no real conceptual understanding of what actually goes on, and promptly forget about it. Maybe they'll remember how to write a recursive Fibonacci sequence procedure.</p></font><p><font color="#000000">Software is more than code. It is complex and multi-faceted.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">I can speak to a few anecdotal factors having recently graduated from Stanford.<p>1) The current tech boom.  
There's the perception of being able to easily create a startup or to get a programming job at a tech company. Some major in computer science also for the technical skills it gives even though they plan not to pursue programming as a job.  They may want to become a PM, or a related non day-to-day programming role for which understanding technical concepts is important.</p><p>2) Financial downturn of 08.
Many students who would have previously majored in economics or finance have chosen computer science due to the folding of many investment banks as well as the increasing negative perception of working on Wall Street.</p><p>3) Increase in diversity of the major.
The major has become more interdisciplinary.  You used to be required to take very "hardcore" classes like operating systems and compilers.  Now though with the rise of fields like HCI the major has become more diverse.</p></font><p><font color="#000000">4) Social tipping-point.
There is a common joke at Stanford that everyone is a CS major.  More people majoring in CS means more help from peers who have been through the same classes and can help out.

No matter who you talk to, in any field, there's a huge consensus that having knowledge and experience with computers increase your employment prospects (I'm sure this could be proved by scanning job boards).

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">One of the most interesting (and to me) significant points about this is the amount of non-CS majors taking CS classes.<p>My father, in his 70's, has run several large corporations over his career. We discussed this and he sees no need for "managers to learn to program". His view is that they can just hire computer people. I disagree. My experience is that if you don't know the basics of programming it's hard to know what to even ask for or what is possible. To say nothing of all the time saving personally writing little half hour scripts to do this and that.</p></font><p><font color="#000000">My opinion is that anyone who is serious about a professional career involving information is very well served to know a bit of programming and handicapped if they refuse.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">&gt; but I really doubt there is much of an advantage to teaching your child Depth-First Search<p>There is a <i>huge</i> advantage <i>if</i> you can teach it to him in a way that he can understand it, not just memorize the algorithm, like the unfortunate way kids learn to divide and multiply without understanding wtf they are actually doing, which is a big IF. It's a basic reasoning skill, even more basic than "basic logic" or arithmetic and <i>if</i> you can wire it into a very young mind you've changed that mind <i>for ever.</i> He will understand much better anything from philosophy to the theory of evolution, because you will have <i>primed the mind for algorithms and logic.</i> It doesn't matter if he ends up an investment bank manager or a politician, he will have learned <i>how to understand algorithmic thinking.</i></p><p>90% of the population are, imho, what I call "mud-minds", they are incapable of <i>deep understanding</i> of logic and algorithmic knowledge, they can just learn instructions and apply them, sometimes to great results, but they don't "grok" them. And when it comes to truly abstract concepts that have no direct equivalent in the real world, they can only recite definitions from books, they have no "intuitive vision" of abstractions. And I think they are like this because their parents and teachers fed them a strict diet of 100% practical knowledge and scientific <i>facts</i> and never exposed them to abstract algorithms, patterns and processes. (As a different line of thinking, I think "separating the mind from reality" also helps young minds get a better grip of abstraction, like "running" an algorithm or visualizing a pattern as pieces of a fantasy world or advice of an imaginary companion, though child psychologists would obviously not be happy of such ideas of education...)</p><p>By teaching your kid something like depth-first-search (A* search on a game maze map would be even more awesome if you can grab a kid's attention though...), you give him a chance of not becoming such a "mud mind".</p></font><p><font color="#000000">True, if a kid is technically oriented, you'll probably have more luck teaching him/her general programming before a bunch of algorithms. But the algorithms are the stuff that really "sharpens the mind" and you don't even need programming to get them, they can be explained in more mathematical or more graphical terms. <i>And you don't even need a computer to teach a kid depth-first-search and you don't even have to tell him how it's called or what it is, just try and imprint a deep intuitive understanding of the process and algorithm on his mind.</i></font></p><p><font size="1"><u><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=7793560&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%37%39%33%33%30%35">reply</a></u></font></p></span></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="./Responding to the Explosion of Student Interest in Computer Science [pdf]   Hacker News_files/s.gif" height="1" width="80"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7793524" onclick="return vote(this)" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=7793524&dir=up&by=L_Rahman&auth=11330b4dbb660d7117589b83e4e8d4cc9296ac2d&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%37%39%33%33%30%35"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7793524"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jacquesm">jacquesm</a> 22 hours ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7793524">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#737373">One of the concepts I have been thinking about for an education system is based on this triad:<p>- Symbol (mathematical languages / abstract interfaces)</p><p>- Human (natural languages / human-human interfaces)</p><p>- Machine (programming languages / human-computer interfaces)</p><p>Any particular subject or area of study is taught and learned using all 3 approaches taken together. Used as a foundational educational framework, this system could have potential to help cross discipline study through the assimilation of fundamental aspects of computer science, cognitive science, linguistics, and math into other fields. This also allows people to skip learning these topics as unpleasant prerequisites, which may not be well integrated with their field's particular goals.</p></font><p><font color="#737373">Existing universities and schools will not be able to transition to these sorts of new holistic systems. Entirely new systems based on modern first principles must be created for the future of education.</font></p><p><font size="1"><u><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=7794657&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%37%39%33%33%30%35">reply</a></u></font></p></span></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>
