<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">For those who aren't familiar with Aesop Rock, I'd invite you to give him a listen sometime. His earlier albums, in particular, have been very influential to me in many ways. Both in my artistic and professional careers.<p>From comments on the conditions of the working man and the condition of feeling trapped in a "j-o-b"[1]:</p><p></p><pre><code>   "Now we the American working population
   Hate the fact that eight hours a day
   Is wasted on chasing the dream of someone that isn't us
   And we may not hate our jobs
   But we hate jobs in general
   That don't have to do with fighting our own causes
   We the American working population
   Hate the nine-to-five day-in day-out
   When we'd rather be supporting ourselves
   By being paid to perfect the pastimes
   That we have harbored based solely on the fact
   That it makes us smile if it sounds dope"
</code></pre>
To storytelling masterpieces regarding living and dreaming[2]:<p></p><pre><code>   "Look, I've never had a dream in my life
   Because a dream is what you wanna do, but still haven't pursued
   I knew what I wanted and did it till it was done
   So I've been the dream that I wanted to be since day one!"
</code></pre>
Aesop Rock takes language and linguistics to entirely different levels than one might expect from the single genre that is hip-hop. He even challenges himself and the listeners, playing fantastic word games, for instance re-using the letters L, S, and D in odd and rhythmical ways after a mention[3]:<p></p><pre><code>   "Lazy summer days
   Like some decrepit landshark dumb luck squad dog lurks sicker deluded
   Last sturdy domino lean's secluded
   Don't let stupid delusions lesson super-duty labor students
   Dragnet lifer solutions
   Daddy loved sloppy dimensions like son-daughter links
   Such determinated lepers, successfully disheveled
   Little soliders developed like serpents despite life sentence ducking
   Lemmings
   Some don't like sobriety's dirty lenses
   Some do"
</code></pre>
And then there are just incredible gems that stick with you like[4]:<p></p><pre><code>   "I don't flick neeedles like my sick friend
   I don't march like Beetle Bailey through a quick trend
   I don't frequent church's steeples on my weekend
   And I don't comment if you formulate a weak Zen"
</code></pre>
There's a lot to explore from Aesop Rock. Should you find this type of hip-hop interesting, a decent place to start is with the label you can find these songs on, Definitive Jux[5]. Incredible talent has been on and off that label over the years. So much good stuff.<p>[1] - "9-5ers Anthem" - <a href="http://rapgenius.com/Aesop-rock-9-5ers-anthem-lyrics" rel="nofollow">http://rapgenius.com/Aesop-rock-9-5ers-anthem-lyrics</a></p><p>[2] - "No Regrets" - <a href="http://rapgenius.com/Aesop-rock-no-regrets-lyrics" rel="nofollow">http://rapgenius.com/Aesop-rock-no-regrets-lyrics</a></p><p>[3] - "The Greatest Pac-Man Victory in History" - <a href="http://rapgenius.com/Aesop-rock-the-greatest-pac-man-victory-in-history-lyrics" rel="nofollow">http://rapgenius.com/Aesop-rock-the-greatest-pac-man-victory...</a></p><p>[4] - "Save Yourself" - <a href="http://rapgenius.com/Aesop-rock-save-yourself-lyrics" rel="nofollow">http://rapgenius.com/Aesop-rock-save-yourself-lyrics</a></p></font><p><font color="#000000">[5] - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definitive_Jux" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definitive_Jux</a></font></p><p><font size="1"><u><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=7694988&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%36%39%34%34%33%36">reply</a></u></font></p></span></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="./rappers_files/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7695026" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=7695026&dir=up&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%36%39%34%34%33%36"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7695026"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=leorocky"><font color="#3c963c">leorocky</font></a> 14 hours ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7695026">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">The inverse of broad appeal is the concept of The Long Tail, where there's a vast array of niche artists, that appeal to a small number of people.<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Tail" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Tail</a></p><p>There's a book by the same title, written by Chris Anderson:</p><p><a href="http://www.thelongtail.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.thelongtail.com</a></p><p>Prior to the internet, when advertising and media outlets were centralized, and retail businesses were distributed geographically, it was very difficult to gain a large following with niche appeal. But now that the internet has inverted the scenario, with decentralized, global exposure, and centralized market places like ebay and amazon, niche artists have a fighting chance at becoming famous within their genre.</p><p>In other words, it used to be that the only way to catch some exposure was to appeal to centralized broadcasting networks, and they only took chances on performers who were low risk. Now, with the internet, risk doesn't really matter, and mass appeal is literally measured by the size of your following. The larger your following is, by default, the more compromises you'll have made to appeal to everyone following you.</p><p>If you capture 1/2 the world as your audience, then you appeal to a broader, and more diverse audience, which has less in common with each other member of your audience, than if you managed to capture 1/4 the world. Getting half the world to agree on something, as opposed to creating something that three quarters of the world cannot relate to.</p></font><p><font color="#000000">So, Aesop Rock raps about hating your boss, and many people say: "Gee, yeah, I hate my boss too!

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Aesop is an excellent lyricist. In fact all the MCs on the Rhymesayers label are very talented: Brother Ali, Slug (of Atmosphere) etc.<p>One MC whose vocabulary always leaves me taken aback is RA Scion, who has been part of the group Common Market. Their song, "My Pathology" [0] is a shining example:</p><p></p><pre><code>    "Below the terra ferma's the murmur of many men
    Resonatin' the predication of RA's eponym
    It requires a higher degree of thought to transmit
    Elevate above the base and retrace the semantics
    Incommensurately we've been held incommunicado
    From commoner to commodore – they breed bravado
    I exercise authority over the lesser ranks
    We rally and tally up at the shores of the West Bank"

</code></pre>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Really interesting, but not as representative as it should be. It's not clear why some have larger vocabulary than others. It could be using words like "zeitgeist" (in case of Aesop Rock) or some clever wordplay (I don't know much about hip-hop, so I can't find example for some artist from the list right off the bat, but I remember Marilyn Manson using word "gloominati" for instance) or pretty meaningless made up words like "schizzle" (in case of Snoop Dogg) or usual derivatives like "fuckedy fuck". Moreover, in many transcripts for hip-hop people write down words as they are pronounced, which can be pretty much distorted for some artists (which of course ideally shouldn't count as a "new word", but that's complicated, yeah).<p>While Aeson Rock and DMX are clearly extreme and not surprising at all, it's not that clear for some guys in the middle.</p></font><p><font color="#000000">So, first off, for every data project sources should be provided, or at least more specific definition, how text was processed, tokenized, analyzed.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Of course it's entirely up to you what to provide. It would be silly of me to question that. I'm not paying you for that, so how can I demand anything? I'm just saying what I think should've been done. That's how I would do it, at least.<p>You see, I have a strong opinion on that any data-analytic work is pretty close to being useless if it's not reproducible. And I mean <i>really</i> close. I already mentioned few questions that naturally arise reading your article which are crucial to understand your results and are not addressed by the article. So, ideally, any data analysis done for the open community should provide both full dataset and full sources. Unfortunately, it's not always possible: dataset may be several terabytes long, there might be legal issues about disclosure of the data (or letting everyone know <i>how exactly</i> author acquired them), sources might be under NDA, whatever. In this case description should be as pedantic as possible, because some little details can change the whole meaning of statistics entirely.</p><p>By the way, NLTK allows you to do all kinds of processing, so it isn't the answer.</p></font><p><font color="#000000">So what would I do? The usual course, actually: would do the work in iPython Notebook, cleaning it up afterwards, would've drawn graphs in place and printed some few slices I've said already while processing, so it would be easier to understand what actually that unique words counted might be like. While fancy d3 graphs are cool for sure, but not nearly as useful.</font></p><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></p></span></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="./rappers_files/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7696837" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=7696837&dir=up&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%36%39%34%34%33%36"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7696837"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=duney">duney</a> 4 hours ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7696837">link</a></span></div><br>

He isn't as underground as many people assume, still relatively unknown in the mainstream, but well known enough to sell records and sell-out shows.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Maybe this is just me, but it's a little unfair to compare to literary <i>texts</i>.<p>Humour me for a moment.</p><p>When an artist writes a song, he (or she) has constraints.  Most rappers would like to rhyme the ends of their sentences.  I know sometimes they don't (like poetry), but it's certainly pleasing to the ear to have that constraint.  Artists endeavour to make their songs catchy, that's highly correlated with the gross sales of the product.</p><p>When an artist writes a novel, this constraint is not weighted quite as highly.  I know Shakespeare wrote poetry, too, and to call me out on this comparison is entirely fair.  That said, there's also an argument to be made for eye rhymes.  Shakespeare used these a lot.  Eye rhymes are words that don't rhyme aurally, but <i>do</i> rhyme visually.  It's the story that pleases the reader, not necessarily its aural 'catchiness'.  I probably made that word up.  But Shakespeare made words up too.  The point is, you knew what I meant.</p></font><p><font color="#000000">At the end of the day these comparisons, while certainly <i>interesting</i>, should be taken with a pinch of salt.  While I'm at it, this advice can easily be extrapolated to any dataset.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">I've been wanting to do some NLP on rap genius's corpus for ages. This is a great analysis. What I had thought of is write a program to detect ghostwriting. Rappers probably have some sort of lyrical 'DNA' in the construction of their verses. How often they use certain words, number of words per line, number of unique words per song, ratio of adjectives to nouns, that kind of thing. You could probably unmask some ghost-writing secrets.</font><p><font color="#000000">Looking at the analysis here, it's interesting  to see some clustering in the results. IMO the second cluster is the sweet spot: Wu Tang's excessive invention of vocabulary is cool but probably detracts from the poetic effect. Meanwhile rappers like 2Pac are just kind of boring IMO, at least going by their lyrics alone.</font></p><p><font size="1"><u><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=7695575&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%36%39%34%34%33%36">reply</a></u></font></p></span></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="./rappers_files/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7694985" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=7694985&dir=up&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%36%39%34%34%33%36"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7694985"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=S_A_P">S_A_P</a> 14 hours ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7694985">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">I think the only problem I see is that some rap groups are listed as rappers. For instance beastie boys, de la soul and wu tang are listed. So there is some collective vocabulary being compared to single rappers. That said this is cool and pretty telling. From what I could see it is probably loosely couple to the intelligence of the rappers listed. I will echo the sentiments about DMX here. Looks like some shock jock rappers definitely are low on the list (too short).</font></span><p><font size="1"><u><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=7694985&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%36%39%34%34%33%36">reply</a></u></font></p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="./rappers_files/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7695002" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=7695002&dir=up&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%36%39%34%34%33%36"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7695002"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rmk2">rmk2</a> 14 hours ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7695002">link</a></span></div><br>

Add the fact that GZA, Ghostface, Raekwon, and Method Man's solo works are also in the top 20 – notably, GZA at #2.

<span class="comment"><font color="#737373">The estimate of vocabulary size here is based on the number of unique words used. This seems like it is strongly biased: if two artists have the same size vocabulary, but one has released more albums and thus used more words, that artist will probably have used more unique words. To underscore this point, the number of unique words used by Aesop Rock is half of the estimated vocabulary size of the average college student, although to be fair that estimate is the number of words that an individual can recognize, not the number of words they use. (Edit: the bias is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the same number of words is used to estimate the vocabulary for each artist, but the bias is not dependent on sample size alone but also upon the size of the artist's underlying vocabulary; see my comments below.)<p>The underlying problem is one of estimating the cardinality of a multinomial distribution given a fixed number of samples. In isolation this problem is ill-posed, since it is always possible that there is a word in a given lyricist's vocabulary that he uses with very low frequency and that is unlikely to appear in any sample, but with appropriate prior information it may be possible to obtain an accurate estimate.</p></font><p><font color="#737373">This is not my field, but a brief Google Scholar search shows that there are several papers on estimating vocabulary size, or equivalently, estimating the number of species based on sampling. There is a somewhat dated review (<a href="http://cvcl.mit.edu/SUNSeminar/BungeFitzpatrick_1993.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://cvcl.mit.edu/SUNSeminar/BungeFitzpatrick_1993.pdf</a>) that details some methods of estimation (in this case, I believe we are in the domain of "infinite population, multinomial sample" with unequal class sizes). The paper notes that there is no unbiased estimator available without assumptions on the distribution of word use frequencies, but some of the proposed estimators may be more accurate than the naive estimate used here.</font></p><p><font size="1"><u><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=7695220&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%36%39%34%34%33%36">reply</a></u></font></p></span></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="./rappers_files/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7695288" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=7695288&dir=up&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%36%39%34%34%33%36"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7695288"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=superuser2">superuser2</a> 13 hours ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7695288">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Yes, I missed that, even though it is very clearly spelled out (oops!). It makes the ordinal comparison valid (modulo noise), but it does not completely address the concern. If you have two artists, and artist 1 uses 5,000 unique words in 35,000 lyrics while artist 2 uses 10,000 unique words in 35,000 lyrics, artist 2's vocabulary may be substantially more than twice as large as artist 1's.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">If we are really only interested in the number of unique words in the first 35,000 lyrics each of these artists have produced and not in what they say about the artists themselves or how the number generalizes to the rest of their body of work, then yes, the analysis is exact and perfect. I don't think that's really the goal, though. We are interested in drawing inferences about the artists and their work. As I say above, the rankings are correct modulo noise (there is noise, unless we wouldn't find it meaningful that these numbers could be different for different 35,000 word samples for the same artist and it is impossible that they could be different for the first 35,000 words due to causes unrelated to those that we are trying to measure), but the magnitudes of the differences could be pretty far off.</font></span><p><font size="1"><u><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=7696157&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%36%39%34%34%33%36">reply</a></u></font></p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="./rappers_files/s.gif" height="1" width="120"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7695426" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=7695426&dir=up&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%36%39%34%34%33%36"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7695426"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=logicallee">logicallee</a> 12 hours ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7695426">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">This is a very good point - Aesop Rock, for example, uses one unique word every 5 words (7k unique in 35k), and if this does not stop, maybe he would continue and we would find the same average in 70k or 120k words.  After all, you still have to have filler words like "to", "a", "the", "have", etc - he could be saturating the spots where he can put uniques.<p>So this could substantially underrepresent vocabularies.  There are only so many unique words you can put in a sentence.  As an extreme, if we looked at the first hundred words of every rapper, we would not find a hundred unique words in any of them: (due to repeats of grammatically common words) even though, clearly, all rappers have a vocabulary over a hundred.</p></font><p><font color="#000000">I wonder if this is a fatal flaw?  How can we estimate where the distortion stops?  (For example, if someone uses 1000 words in their first 35,000, intuitively this seems to imply to me that's most of their stock.  But if someone uses 5,000 in 35,000 - that is not so clear at all.)</font></p><p><font size="1"><u><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=7695426&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%36%39%34%34%33%36">reply</a></u></font></p></span></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="./rappers_files/s.gif" height="1" width="160"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7695576" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=7695576&dir=up&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%36%39%34%34%33%36"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7695576"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=simonster">simonster</a> 11 hours ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7695576">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">The paper I linked to in my previous comment uses Zipf's law (briefly, the frequency of word use is inversely proportional to its rank; more at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law</a>) to estimate the "distortion." This should produce a better estimate than the naive method, but there are still problems: the plot on the Wikipedia page shows that Zipf's law is not a particularly good fit to word frequency for Wikipedia past the ~10,000th word, and it's not clear that rap music represents a typical natural language corpus. It is probably still possible to devise a correction if one knows how word use frequencies are distributed.</font><p><font color="#000000">A second related problem that that paper touches on toward the end is that sequential words from the same text are not independent samples from an author's vocabulary. Two artists may have the same vocabulary, but if one artist uses more non-sequiturs, fewer articles, fewer repeated phrases, or generally tries to use more unique words within a given song, then that artist will come out ahead in the measure used here. I'm not sure how much of a problem this really is for comparing lyrics between artists (depending on what is of interest, it may actually be desirable), but it may explain the poor showings for Shakespeare and Melville, since prose is likely to repeat words more frequently than rap lyrics for reasons unrelated to the authors' vocabularies. (FWIW, even conservative estimates put Shakespeare's vocabulary at &gt;15,000 words, which would be hard to measure in a sample of 35,000 words.)</font></p><p><font size="1"><u><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=7695576&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%36%39%34%34%33%36">reply</a></u></font></p></span></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="./rappers_files/s.gif" height="1" width="160"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7697145" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=7697145&dir=up&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%36%39%34%34%33%36"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7697145"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=danielsf">danielsf</a> 1 hour ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7697145">link</a></span></div><br>
